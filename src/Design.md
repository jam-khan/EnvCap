# Basic EBNF for a Programming Language

This document provides the Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) specification for a programming language. The EBNF describes the syntax and structure of the language.

## EBNF Specification

<Type>  ::=     "Void"
        |       "Int"
        |       "String"
        |       "Bool"
        |       <Pair>
        |       <Merge>
        |       <Arrow>
        |       <Sum>

<Pair>  := "(" <Type>, <Type> ")"
<Merge> := [ "(" ]  <Type> "&"  <Type> [ ")" ]
<Arrow> := [ "(" ]  <Type> "->" <Type> [ ")" ]
<Sum>   := [ "(" ]  <Type> "+"  <Type> [ ")" ]

<Program>       ::= <Statement>*;

<Statement>     ::= <Assignment> ";"
                |   <Expression> ";"

<Assignment>    ::= <Identifier> ":=" <Expression>

<Expression>    ::= <Variable>
                |   "\" <Variable> "=>" <Type> "." <Expression> 
                |   <Expression> ";"     <Expression> ")"            -- Call
                |   "(" <Expression> [,, <Expression>] ")"           -- Merge
                |   <IfExpression>                                   -- Conditional
                |   <LetBinding>                                     -- Let bindings
                |   <Application>                                    -- Application

<LambdaAbstraction> ::= "\"<Variable>

<IfExpression>  ::= "if"    <ParenExpr>
                    "then"  <ParenExpr>
                    "else"  <ParenExpr>;

<ParenExpr>     ::= '{' <Expression> '}';

<LetBinding> ::= "let" <Identifier> ":" <Type> "=" <Expression> "in" <Expression>


<Application>   ::= <Expression> "("<Arguments>")"

<Arguments>     ::= [<Expression>]

<Identifier>    ::= <Letter> {<Letter> | <Digit>}

<Variable>      ::= <Identifier>

<Letter>        ::= "a" | "b" | ... | "z" | "A" | ... | "Z"
<Digit>         ::= "0" | "1" | ... | "9"
```

## Instructions for Use

1. **Setup**: Ensure you have the `naive-ebnf.sty` file uploaded to your LaTeX project.
2. **Compile**: Use a LaTeX editor (like Overleaf) to compile the document and generate a PDF containing the EBNF specification.
3. **Modify**: Feel free to modify the EBNF rules as needed to fit your specific programming language requirements.

## Conclusion

This README provides a basic setup for using EBNF in LaTeX. For further details on EBNF or LaTeX, refer to their respective documentation.
